## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](docs/00-INDEX.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/WistantKode/skooly/issues) that might help you. In case you've found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/WistantKode/skooly/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/WistantKode/skooly/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
