## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Send an email immediately to **<security@skooly.io>**.
3. Include:
    * Description of the flaw.
    * Steps to reproduce.
    * Potential impact.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours.

## Policy

* We practice **Responsible Disclosure**.
* We commit to fixing critical vulnerabilities within 7 days.
* We will properly credit you in the release notes (if you wish).

## Critical Areas (Pay Attention)

Since Skooly handles sensitive data (Grades, Payments, Identity), we are extra vigilant on:

* **Payment Webhooks**: Ensure `HMAC` signature verification from MTN/Orange.
* **Grade Modification**: Ensure strict audit logs for any `UPDATE` on `Grade` table.
* **PII Leakage**: No student personal data in logs.
